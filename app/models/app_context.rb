# 
# =Application Context
#
# ==Usage Declare
# The instance of AppContext will exist in every controller
#
# Because controller was created to serve some request identified by url 
# then the attached app_context can provide separate context for every action
#
# Even more, we needn't define the context one by one, and we can reuse in:
# * Class Inheritance 
# * Controller Actions(All actions, some actions)
# two dimension to DRY
# 
# All app contexts are defined by DSL customize(...)
#
# == Detail Introduction
# *controller*: Construction parameter, readonly
#  the controller name binded by this context
#  Eg: UsersController's controller name is *users*
# *action*: Construction parameter, readonly
#  the action name binded by this context, :all means all action
#  Eg: UsersController#index action name is *index*
# 
# *skin*: the skin used by this context, default value is 'basic'
# *structure*: the structure defined by nested view components
# *menu*: the menu of this page
# *sidebar*: the sidebar of this page
# *selections*: such as selected_menu, selected_group, selected_link
#  
# == Extend
#  You can define even more attributes in the app context or sub-field of the app context(such as app page)
#  your skin or frame renderer should aware all those extended attributes
#

  # The Selected Path of the Menu/SideBar/LinkGroup
  # It's an array with 3 elements like:
  #  ['merchants', 'merchants_bar', 'merchant']
  # cooresponding to:
  #  * The selected link name in current menuï¼Œ
  #  * The selected group name in current sidebar
  #  * The selected link name in current link group of current sidebar
  #
  # The reason we put those path info here is:
  #  AppContext is per controller/action per instance
  #  But the LinkGroup/Sidebar is shared in global scope
  #  If we record the selected path in them, it will affect across controller and actions
